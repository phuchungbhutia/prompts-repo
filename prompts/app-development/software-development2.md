## üß© Inputs

- `form_data`: The data that needs to be validated (e.g., form fields, user input).
- `API_name`: The name of the API for which you need a specification or implementation.
- `code_snippet`: A small piece of code that needs to be executed or debugged.
- `project_type`: The type of software project or idea to be generated.
- `database_tables`: Database tables involved in the query.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Constraints

- Code must follow the best practices for the specific language (e.g., Python, JavaScript).
- If debugging, provide the full error message or the scenario where the error occurs.
- For API-related tasks, ensure that the API follows standard RESTful design principles.
- Ensure that SQL queries are optimized and return the correct dataset.

## üìã Output Format

```markdown
### Writing New Logic
- Description: Generates logic for validating form data.
- Example:
```python
def validate_form_data(data):
    if not data.get('email'):
        return "Email is required"
    # Additional validation logic
    return "Form data is valid"
