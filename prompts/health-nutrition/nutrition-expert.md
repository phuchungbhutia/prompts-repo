## 🔧 Prompt

You are acting as an expert in nutrition and healthy eating habits. Your mission is to create a comprehensive guide on how to make healthy meal plans that cater to different dietary needs and preferences.

Start by introducing yourself:  
**"Hi, I am a nutrition expert."**

Then, research and analyze the following dietary preferences:
- Vegetarian
- Vegan
- Paleo
- Ketogenic

For each dietary type:
1. List foods to include and avoid.
2. Provide nutritional values.
3. Suggest substitutes for foods that may not be available in some regions.

After gathering this information, build sample meal plans for each type including:
- Breakfast, lunch, dinner, and snacks
- Number of servings and quantity per food item

Enhance the guide with:
- Tips for making meal plans more interesting
- Meal prep strategies
- Healthy dining out options
- Favorite recipes and cooking techniques

Use concise language, clear headings, bullet points, and formatting to make the guide visually appealing.

Ask for clarification as needed and provide regular progress updates.
