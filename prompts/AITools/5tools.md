---

## üîß Prompt

Use these five method-specific prompts to help founders and CEOs approach challenges more strategically:

1. **Pre-Mortem Analysis**  
   Imagine a launch has failed. Ask ChatGPT to identify reasons for failure, categorize them by likelihood and impact, and propose mitigations.

   ```
   Imagine our company is launching a new [product/service/strategy] and it fails six months from now. List all the potential reasons why it could fail. Then, categorize each reason based on likelihood and impact, and suggest ways to avoid or mitigate them.
   ```

   Bonus:
   ```
   Please present it in a table format with columns for Risk, Likelihood (High/Low), Impact (High/Low), and Mitigation Strategy.
   ```

2. **The 5 Whys Technique**  
   Use this to uncover root causes of recurring problems.

   ```
   We are facing the problem: [describe the problem, e.g., 'We missed our revenue target this quarter']. Please apply the 5 Whys technique to explore the root cause of this issue, showing each 'Why' step clearly.
   ```

   Bonus:
   ```
   Conclude with a brief root cause summary and one practical recommendation to address it.
   ```

3. **Decision Tree Analysis**  
   Ideal for complex decisions with multiple variables.

   ```
   Help me build a decision tree for the following decision: [e.g., 'Choosing between outsourcing our marketing or building an in-house team']. Please outline the major options, associated risks, outcomes, and help identify which path is more favorable based on assumed probabilities or returns.
   ```

   Bonus:
   ```
   Format the decision tree visually or as a nested bullet list with Risk, Reward, and Recommendation for each branch.
   ```

4. **Rapid SWOT Analysis**  
   Quickly review a company‚Äôs strategic standing.

   ```
   Can you perform a rapid SWOT analysis for our company [Company Name or Industry]? Focus on:  
   - Strengths: What are we doing well?  
   - Weaknesses: What‚Äôs holding us back?  
   - Opportunities: Where can we grow or win quickly?  
   - Threats: What external risks or disruptions are coming?
   ```

   Bonus:
   ```
   Please include 2‚Äì3 bullet points per category and suggest one key strategy based on the analysis.
   ```

5. **Impact vs. Effort Matrix**  
   Prioritize tasks with clarity.

   ```
   Here‚Äôs a list of initiatives or tasks we‚Äôre considering: [insert 5‚Äì10 tasks]. Please categorize them into an Impact vs. Effort matrix with four quadrants:  
   - Quick Wins (High Impact, Low Effort)  
   - Strategic Plays (High Impact, High Effort)  
   - Automate/Delegate (Low Impact, Low Effort)  
   - Time Wasters (Low Impact, High Effort).  
   Also suggest which to prioritize first and why.
   ```

   Bonus:
   ```
   Format the output as a table or bullet list under each quadrant.
   ```
