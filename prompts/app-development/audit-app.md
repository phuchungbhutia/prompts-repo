## Prompt

I am developing a cross-platform mobile and web application for **auditors** to **record observations, generate downloadable/shareable audit reports, and manage data**. The app must support **Android, iOS, and web** with a single codebase, using **Flutter or React Native**. I prioritize **free and open-source tools, minimal cost, ease of use, and scalability**.

Below are the detailed requirements and questions to guide your response.

**App Requirements:**

**Functionality:**
- Allow users to **input observations via forms with text, images, and checkboxes**.
- Generate **PDF reports with customizable templates** that can be **downloaded and shared via email or cloud storage like Google Drive**.
- Support **offline storage for observations and cloud syncing for cross-device access**.
- Provide a **web dashboard for viewing, editing, and managing reports**.
- Include **user authentication and role-based access for auditors**.

**Technical Constraints:**
- Use **Flutter or React Native** for cross-platform development.
- Leverage **free and open-source programming frameworks, databases, and deployment platforms**.
- Ensure **fast PDF rendering, smooth UI for forms, and reliable offline functionality**.
- Support **secure data storage, SSL/TLS for API calls, and protection of sensitive audit data**.

**Development Preferences:**
- Recommend **free/open-source AI coding tools** to assist with **code generation, debugging, UI design, and testing**.
- Prioritize **fully free tools or free tiers with sufficient limits for small-scale apps**.
- Suggest **free tutorials, documentation, or communities** for beginner or intermediate developers.
- Ensure compatibility with **VS Code** and **GitHub**.

**Deployment Requirements:**
- Recommend **free web hosting sites like Netlify, Supabase, or Render** for deploying the **web app and backend APIs**.
- Ensure **free SSL, Git-based deployment, and support for databases like PostgreSQL**.
- Highlight **hosting limitations (e.g., bandwidth, storage, or sleep times)** and strategies to stay within free tiers.
- Suggest **deployment workflows for mobile apps to Google Play/App Store and web apps to hosting platforms**.

**Questions to Address:**

**Framework Comparison:**
- Compare **Flutter vs. React Native** for suitability based on **performance, UI consistency, web support, and ease of learning**.
- Recommend the best framework for my use case and justify the choice with specific advantages for **PDF generation, offline storage**.

**Tools and Skills:**
- List the **specific tools (frameworks, databases, IDEs, libraries)** needed for development, specifying which are **free/open-source**.
- Detail the **skills required (e.g., programming, UI/UX, database management)** and how to acquire them using **free resources**.
- Recommend **AI coding tools (e.g., Codeium, Tabnine)** that support **Flutter/React Native**, explaining how they assist with **code generation and debugging**.

**AI Integration:**
- Suggest **free/open-source AI tools** for **coding, UI design, testing, and deployment**.
- Explain integration with **Flutter, Supabase, Netlify** and how they enhance **form creation, PDF generation**.
- Address **AI limitations** and **best practices for secure use** with sensitive data.

**Database and Backend:**
- Recommend **SQLite for offline** and **PostgreSQL for cloud**, suitable for **storing observations and syncing reports**.
- Suggest **backend solutions like Supabase Edge Functions or Node.js** for **API management and user authentication**.
- Provide **integration details** with **Flutter/React Native using specific libraries**.

**Deployment and Hosting:**
- List **free hosting platforms (Netlify, Supabase, Render, Fly.io)** with their **features and limitations**.
- Recommend a **hosting strategy** for **web and backend components**.
- Outline a **deployment workflow** using **GitHub, Netlify, and app store submission**, and tools like **GitHub Actions**.

**Development Workflow:**
- Propose a step-by-step **plan: planning, coding, testing, deployment**.
- Include **testing strategies** using tools like **Flutter Test, Jest**.
- Suggest **user feedback collection** methods to iterate the app.

**Community and Learning Support:**
- Recommend **free resources (e.g., freeCodeCamp, YouTube)** for **Flutter/React Native and Supabase**.
- Suggest **communities (Stack Overflow, Reddit, X)** for support and **real-time insights**.

**Additional Instructions:**
- Provide a recommended tech stack: **Flutter, SQLite, Supabase, Netlify** with justification.
- Include **code snippets, AI prompts, or commands** to illustrate implementation.
- Highlight **cost-saving tips** and **security best practices**.
- Clarify free-tier limitations and **open-source alternatives** to proprietary tools.

**Keep the response comprehensive yet concise**, focusing on **actionable advice** and **specific tools/features** tailored to my use case.

**Example Context for My App:**
I want to build a cross-platform app for auditors to **record observations (text, images, checkboxes)** and **generate PDF reports** that can be **downloaded and shared** via email or cloud storage. The app must support **Android, iOS, and web**, with **offline storage (SQLite)** and **cloud syncing (PostgreSQL)**. I prefer **Flutter** but am open to **React Native**. I need **free/open-source tools**, **free hosting** (e.g., Netlify, Supabase), and **AI coding assistants (e.g., Codeium)** to streamline development. Provide a detailed plan including **tools, skills, AI integration, and deployment**, with **free learning resources** and **community support**.

## Usage
- Replace any bracketed placeholders with your actual use case.
