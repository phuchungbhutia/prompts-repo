3. **Project Context**  
   - Provide background information or relevant details for ChatGPT to tailor outputs.  
   - Example: *Focus on building an online presence rather than sales during early growth stages.*

4. **Output Specifications**

   - Example: *Avoid mentioning competitors or using sales-focused language.*

6. **Output Examples**
