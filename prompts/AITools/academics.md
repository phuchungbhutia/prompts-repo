## Ethical AI Use in Academic Writing – Step-by-Step Guide & Prompt Sheet

This guide helps you use AI tools like ChatGPT **ethically** in your academic writing. Follow each step to improve your writing **without compromising your originality or academic integrity**.

---

### ✅ Step-by-Step Guide

#### **1. Start with Your Own Ideas**
- **Write your thesis, arguments, and outline first.**
- Don’t rely on AI to build your core content.
> **Example:**  
> “I believe renewable energy is essential to combating climate change because it reduces dependency on fossil fuels.”

---

#### **2. Write a Complete Draft**
- Focus on content first—don’t worry about grammar or flow yet.
- Your draft is your voice—AI helps you sharpen it, not replace it.

---

#### **3. Use This Prompt to Edit Ethically**

```txt
You are a professional academic editor. Your job is to improve the clarity, coherence, and style of my writing without changing any of the original ideas or introducing new content. Focus on grammar, sentence structure, flow, and academic tone. Do not remove or reframe my arguments—just help me express them more effectively.
```

---

#### **4. Edit in Small Sections**
- Submit 2–3 paragraphs at a time to keep control over the revisions.
- Review each edit before applying.

---

#### **5. Maintain Your Voice**
- Use AI to enhance, not rewrite.
- Always tweak suggestions to sound like you.

> **Example:**  
> **You wrote:**  
> “This is bad for the environment.”  
> **AI suggests:**  
> “This poses significant environmental risks.”  
> **Your version:**  
> “This negatively impacts the environment.” *(your tone preserved)*

---

#### **6. Acknowledge AI Use Transparently**
- If allowed, mention AI in your submission notes:
> “This work was edited using AI tools for grammar and clarity. All ideas and content are my own.”
