# Learn Anything 5x Faster with These 9 Proven Methods

Want to accelerate your learning? Here’s your ultimate guide to mastering any subject quickly using **9 top learning frameworks**, backed by cognitive science and used by top performers around the world.

---

## 🧠 1. Feynman Technique – Explain Simply

**How it works:**
Explain a concept as if you're teaching a 5-year-old. Identify gaps in your understanding and fill them.

**Examples:**
- Studying biology? Explain “Mitochondria” as the “battery of the cell.”
- Learning finance? Teach “Compound Interest” using a piggy bank story.

**Prompts:**
- "Explain [TOPIC] as if I’m a 5-year-old using simple, everyday language."
- "Where are the gaps in my understanding of [TOPIC]? Help me identify and fill them."
- "I’ll teach you [TOPIC]—interrupt me with questions where my explanation isn’t clear."

---

## 🧩 2. Dual Coding – Words + Visuals

**How it works:**
Combine text and visuals to deepen understanding.

**Use cases:**
- Draw a diagram of the food chain while learning ecosystems.
- Annotate maps while studying geography.

**Prompts:**
- "Create a diagram or infographic to visually represent the concept of [TOPIC]."
- "Explain [TOPIC] in both a paragraph and a drawing or visual metaphor."
- "Give me both a textual explanation and a visual example of how [TOPIC] works."

---

## 🔁 3. Spaced Repetition – Beat the Forgetting Curve

**How it works:**
Review information at strategic intervals to boost retention.

**Tools:** Anki, Quizlet, Notion

**Prompts:**
- "Help me build a spaced repetition schedule for learning [TOPIC] over the next 30 days."
- "Quiz me on [TOPIC] with increasing difficulty. Remind me to review after 1, 3, 7 days."
- "What’s a 5-step spaced review plan to retain [TOPIC] for the long term?"

---

## 🔀 4. Interleaving – Mix It Up

**How it works:**
Mix multiple subjects or topics while studying to increase adaptability.

**Study Routine Example:**
- 30 mins Algebra, 30 mins Geometry, 30 mins Physics

**Prompts:**
- "Create a mixed study plan for [SUBJECT 1], [SUBJECT 2], and [SUBJECT 3] to improve retention."
- "What topics should I alternate between if I’m learning math, coding, and physics?"
- "How can I interleave concepts in [FIELD] to improve critical thinking?"

---

## 🗺 5. Mind Maps – Visualize Concepts

**How it works:**
Start with a central idea and branch into subtopics.

**Tools:** XMind, Miro, pen & paper

**Prompts:**
- "Create a mind map starting from [MAIN TOPIC] and expand into subtopics and examples."
- "Help me break down [COMPLEX TOPIC] into a visual mind map with 3 levels of branches."
- "Can you build a mind map from this article/text I just read?"

---

## 🧱 6. Chunking – Learn in Groups

**How it works:**
Break complex information into small, manageable chunks.

**Example:** Break “9172635482” into 917–263–5482 for easy memorization.

**Prompts:**
- "Break [TOPIC] into digestible chunks. List them in logical order for easier memorization."
- "What’s a 5-chunk breakdown of [TOPIC] to study one piece at a time?"
- "How can I chunk these vocabulary terms/formulas/ideas for easier memorization?"

---

## 🎯 7. Pareto Principle – 80/20 Rule

**How it works:**
Focus on the 20% of knowledge that yields 80% of results.

**Use case:** Learn Excel’s top 5 formulas before deep-diving into everything.

**Prompts:**
- "What’s the 20% of [TOPIC] that will give me 80% of the value?"
- "List high-leverage skills or ideas in [FIELD] I should focus on first."
- "If I only had 2 hours to learn [TOPIC], what should I focus on using the 80/20 rule?"

---

## 📖 8. SQ3R Method – Read Like a Pro

**How it works:**
Survey, Question, Read, Recite, Review.

**Best for:** Academic reading, competitive exams

**Prompts:**
- "Guide me through SQ3R for this chapter/article on [TOPIC]."
- "Help me preview and question this topic before I start reading it."
- "After reading this section on [TOPIC], can you help me summarize and review it?"

---

## 📉 9. Overcome the Dip – Push Through

**How it works:**
The “dip” is the motivation drop before mastery. Push through it.

**Tip:** Use motivational triggers like rewards, routines, accountability.

**Prompts:**
- "I feel stuck learning [TOPIC]. Can you motivate me to push through the ‘dip’?"
- "What are signs I’ve hit the learning dip, and how can I break through it?"
- "Give me a strategy to stay consistent when the excitement of learning fades."
