   - Take high-quality, smudge-free photos  
   - Support for **color and black & white scans**  
   - Apply **shadow removal** and **automatic contrast correction**  
   - Enhance clarity for both printed and handwritten text  

2. **Auto Document Edge Detection & Cropping**  
   - Real-time edge detection using **OpenCV**  
   - Auto-crop documents to exact bounds  
   - Maintain accurate perspective correction  

3. **Smart Image Enhancement & Processing**  
   - Remove background noise  
   - Apply contrast enhancement  
   - Auto-rotate and straighten skewed scans  

4. **Multi-Page Scanning**  
   - Add multiple scanned pages  
   - View pages in a reorderable preview stack  
   - Export all pages to a single **PDF**  

5. **OCR (Optical Character Recognition)**  
   - Extract text using **Google ML Kit**  
   - Support for **multi-language OCR**  
   - Detect **handwritten text** using AI-based handwriting recognition

   - Options to save scanned images in **128KB, 256KB, 512KB, or 1MB** sizes  
   - Use automatic format selection: **JPEG, PNG, WebP**  
   - Estimate final file size before saving  
   - Let users override automatic format selection  

7. **Fast Save & Export**  
   - Save scans instantly with optimized speed  
   - Save or export documents as **PDF** or **image formats**  
   - Share via WhatsApp, email, cloud, or print  

8. **Cloud Backup & Share**
